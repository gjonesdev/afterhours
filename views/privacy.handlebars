Last Updated: December 9,2023

Welcome to Afterhours, where happiness is served in a glass with a twist of humor! We understand that privacy is important, even when you're having a blast. So, grab your favorite drink, kick back, and take a moment to read through our Privacy Policy.

1. The Basics: What We Collect

At Afterhours, we only collect the essentials to keep the party going smoothly:

Personal Information: Just your name, email address and location, so we can send you exclusive invites and updates on the coolest happy hours in town. 

Drink Preferences: We want to make sure your glass is always filled with your favorite concoction. Let us know what you like, and we'll do our best to keep the spirits high.

2. Cookies, the Tasty Kind

We use cookies on our website, but don't worry, they won't crumble and make a mess. These virtual cookies are here to enhance your experience and help us understand how to make your next visit even better.

3. Why We Collect Data: To Keep the Vibes Positive

We collect your info for a few good reasons:

Personalization: We want to tailor our recommendations based on your drink preferences. Nobody likes a cocktail mismatch!

Communication: Expect invites, event updates, and the occasional witty newsletter. We promise not to spam – we're more like that friend who sends the perfect GIF at the right moment.

4. Who Gets a Sip of Your Data

Rest assured, your data is in good hands. We only share it with our trusted partners who help us host the best happy hours in town. They're sworn to secrecy and won't spill the beans (or your data).

5. Your Rights

You're the VIP here. If you ever want to update your drink preferences, change your contact info, or bid adieu to the Afterhours family, just let us know. It's your party, and you're in control.

6. The Fine Print

This Privacy Policy is like a good cocktail – we crafted it with care. It's effective as of the last update date, and any changes will be posted here. So, check in every now and then to make sure you're up to date on the party rules.

By using Afterhours, you're agreeing to this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or need clarification, reach out to our privacy team at privacy@afterhours.com. They're friendly, we promise.
